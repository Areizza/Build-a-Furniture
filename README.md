# Combined Ideas
- Combine cooking with daddy octopus
> "Welcome to the Daddy Octopus show where I teach you how to cook with your whole body"
- Assembly line: building a computer/engine/gun/furniture
(finding parts knows how the parts go together, putting pieces together knows what the parts look like)

# Assembly Line

A
- Finder - Desktop w/ controller, look for pieces in warehouse room, know how the parts fit together 
- Builder - VR to allow feel for real furniture scale, putting pieces together in workshop/living room, know what parts are needed; if time allows then can have multiple builders
- Both know the objective (final outcome)
- Builder chooses what to build from a bulletin board of bounties or IKEA catalogue (with star rating of difficulty)

B
- Finder - VR, looking around and also arms
- Builder - Desktop controlling legs and knows what is needed (needs to communicate with Finder), builder has full blueprint except the actual materials
